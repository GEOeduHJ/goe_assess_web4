# Requirements Document

## Introduction

채점 시스템에서 사용자가 채점 진행 상황을 실시간으로 확인할 수 있도록 하고, RAG 처리 실패 등의 오류를 적절히 처리하여 사용자에게 명확한 피드백을 제공하는 기능을 구현합니다. 현재 채점이 백그라운드에서 진행되지만 UI에는 진행 상황이 반영되지 않고, RAG 처리 실패 시에도 사용자가 이를 인지할 수 없는 문제를 해결합니다.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a teacher, I want to see real-time progress updates during grading, so that I know which student is currently being graded and the overall progress.

1. WHEN grading starts THEN the system SHALL display the current student being graded
2. WHEN each student's grading is completed THEN the system SHALL update the progress counter (e.g., "2/5 students completed")
3. WHEN grading is in progress THEN the system SHALL show the current student name and grading status
4. WHEN all students are graded THEN the system SHALL display a completion message

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a teacher, I want to be notified when grading is completed successfully, so that I know I can view the results.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN all students are successfully graded THEN the system SHALL display a success message
2. WHEN grading is completed THEN the system SHALL enable access to the results view
3. WHEN grading finishes THEN the system SHALL update the UI to reflect the completed state

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a teacher, I want to be informed about any errors during grading, so that I can understand what went wrong and take appropriate action.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN RAG processing fails for a student THEN the system SHALL display a warning message with the student name
2. WHEN grading fails for a student THEN the system SHALL show the error details and continue with other students
3. WHEN there are processing errors THEN the system SHALL still complete grading for successful students
4. WHEN errors occur THEN the system SHALL provide clear information about which students had issues

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a teacher, I want the grading progress to be displayed in the web interface, so that I don't need to check terminal logs to understand what's happening.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN grading is running THEN the web interface SHALL show live progress updates
2. WHEN student grading starts THEN the UI SHALL display "Grading [student_name]..."
3. WHEN student grading completes THEN the UI SHALL show success/failure status for that student

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a teacher, I want to see a summary of grading results, so that I can quickly understand the overall outcome.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN grading completes THEN the system SHALL display total students processed
2. WHEN grading completes THEN the system SHALL show count of successful vs failed gradings
3. WHEN there were errors THEN the system SHALL list which students had issues
4. WHEN grading is successful THEN the system SHALL provide a clear path to view detailed results
