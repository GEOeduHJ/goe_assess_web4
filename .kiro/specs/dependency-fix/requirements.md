# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The geography auto-grading platform is experiencing a ModuleNotFoundError for the 'psutil' package, which is required by the performance monitoring functionality but is missing from the project dependencies. This spec addresses the immediate dependency issue to restore system functionality.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the application to start without dependency errors, so that the geography auto-grading platform can function properly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application starts THEN the system SHALL NOT raise a ModuleNotFoundError for 'psutil'
2. WHEN the performance optimizer module is imported THEN the system SHALL successfully load all required dependencies
3. WHEN the application runs THEN the system SHALL have access to all performance monitoring capabilities
