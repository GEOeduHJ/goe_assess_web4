# Fix Indentation Error in main_ui.py

## Overview
This document outlines the fix for an indentation error in the `main_ui.py` file at line 319. The error occurs because there's a `with` statement without an indented code block following it.

## Problem Analysis
The error message indicates:
```
IndentationError: expected an indented block after 'with' statement on line 316
```

Looking at the code around lines 316-319 in `ui/main_ui.py`:
```python
with col1:
    # Performance dashboard button removed as part of system monitoring cleanup

with col2:
```

The issue is that the `with col1:` block has a comment but no actual code. In Python, this is invalid syntax as every block must contain at least one statement.

## Solution
Add a `pass` statement to the empty `with` block to make it syntactically valid:

```python
with col1:
    # Performance dashboard button removed as part of system monitoring cleanup
    pass

with col2:
```

## Implementation Steps
1. Open the file `ui/main_ui.py`
2. Navigate to line 316 where the `with col1:` statement is located
3. Add a `pass` statement inside the `with col1:` block
4. Save the file
5. Verify the application runs without the indentation error

## Code Change Details
The specific change needed is to add `pass` to the empty block:

```python
# Before (error):
with col1:
    # Performance dashboard button removed as part of system monitoring cleanup

# After (fix):
with col1:
    # Performance dashboard button removed as part of system monitoring cleanup
    pass
```

## Validation
After making this change, the application should start without the IndentationError. The `pass` statement is a null operation in Python and will not affect the functionality of the application.

## Additional Notes
This error typically occurs during code refactoring when removing code blocks. When removing functionality, it's important to ensure that syntax remains valid even if blocks become empty temporarily.
