# RAG Service Syntax Error Fix

## Overview
This document describes the syntax error in the `rag_service.py` file and provides a solution to fix it. The error occurs in the `__init__` method of the `RAGService` class where the method signature is malformed.

## Problem Analysis
The syntax error occurs at line 29 in `services/rag_service.py`. The `__init__` method has an incorrect signature:

```python
def __init__(self, model_name: str = "def _chunk_document(self, content: str, chunk_size: int = 500, overlap: int = 50) -> List[str]:
```

This is clearly malformed as it attempts to include the signature of another method as a default parameter value.

## Root Cause
The error appears to be a result of incorrect code merging or editing, where the `_chunk_document` method signature was accidentally inserted into the `__init__` method signature.

## Solution
The fix involves correcting the `__init__` method signature and ensuring the `_chunk_document` method is properly defined separately.

### Fixed Code Structure

1. Correct the `__init__` method signature:
```python
def __init__(self, model_name: str = "KURE-v1"):
    """
    Initialize RAG service with KURE-v1 embedding model.
    
    Args:
        model_name: Name of the embedding model to use
    """
    self.model_name = model_name
    self.embedding_model = None
    self.faiss_index = None
    self.document_chunks = []
    self.chunk_metadata = []
    self.embedding_dimension = 768  # KURE-v1 embedding dimension
    
    # Setup logging
    self.logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)
```

2. Ensure the `_chunk_document` method is properly defined as a separate method:
```python
def _chunk_document(self, content: str, chunk_size: int = 500, overlap: int = 50) -> List[str]:
    """
    Split document content into overlapping chunks for better retrieval.
    
    Args:
        content: Document text content
        chunk_size: Maximum number of characters per chunk
        overlap: Number of characters to overlap between chunks
        
    Returns:
        List of text chunks
    """
    # Method implementation
```

## Implementation Steps
1. Open `services/rag_service.py`
2. Locate the malformed `__init__` method (around line 29)
3. Replace the incorrect method signature with the correct one
4. Verify that the `_chunk_document` method is properly defined separately
5. Test the fix by running the application

## Testing
After implementing the fix, verify that:
1. The syntax error is resolved
2. The RAG service can be instantiated without errors
3. The document processing functionality works as expected
4. The chunking mechanism functions correctly with the specified parameters

## Impact
This fix resolves the critical syntax error that prevents the application from starting, allowing users to proceed with file uploads, rubric configuration, and grading execution.
