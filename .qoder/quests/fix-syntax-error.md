# Fix for Syntax Error in RAG Service

## Overview

This document describes the fix for a syntax error in the `rag_service.py` file that is preventing the application from running. The error is a result of a corrupted method definition that merges the `__init__` method with the `_chunk_document` method.

## Problem Analysis

### Error Details
- **File**: `services/rag_service.py`
- **Line**: 29
- **Error Message**: `SyntaxError: unterminated string literal (detected at line 29)`
- **Corrupted Line**: 
  ```python
  def __init__(self, model_name: str = "def _chunk_document(self, content: str, chunk_size: int = 500, overlap: int = 50) -> List[str]:
  ```

### Root Cause
The `__init__` method definition has been corrupted, causing a syntax error where a string literal is not properly terminated. This appears to be a result of an editing error that merged two separate method definitions.

## Solution Design

### Fix Strategy
1. Correct the corrupted `__init__` method definition
2. Ensure the `_chunk_document` method is properly defined separately
3. Maintain all existing functionality while fixing the syntax error

### Implementation Plan

#### 1. Fix the `__init__` Method
The `__init__` method should be corrected to properly initialize the RAG service with the default model name "KURE-v1".

#### 2. Verify the `_chunk_document` Method
Ensure the `_chunk_document` method is properly defined with correct parameters and return type.

### Code Changes

The fix involves correcting the corrupted method definition in `services/rag_service.py`:

1. Fix the `__init__` method signature to properly close the default parameter string
2. Ensure proper separation between method definitions

## Implementation

### Before (Corrupted Code)
```python
def __init__(self, model_name: str = "def _chunk_document(self, content: str, chunk_size: int = 500, overlap: int = 50) -> List[str]:
```

### After (Fixed Code)
```python
def __init__(self, model_name: str = "KURE-v1"):
    """
    Initialize RAG service with KURE-v1 embedding model.
    
    Args:
        model_name: Name of the embedding model to use
    """
    self.model_name = model_name
    self.embedding_model = None
    self.faiss_index = None
    self.document_chunks = []
    self.chunk_metadata = []
    self.embedding_dimension = 768  # KURE-v1 embedding dimension
    
    # Setup logging
    self.logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)
```

And ensure the `_chunk_document` method is properly defined:
```python
def _chunk_document(self, content: str, chunk_size: int = 500, overlap: int = 100) -> List[str]:
    """
    Split document content into overlapping chunks for better retrieval.
    
    Args:
        content: Document text content
        chunk_size: Maximum number of characters per chunk
        overlap: Number of characters to overlap between chunks
        
    Returns:
        List of text chunks
    """
    # Implementation details...
```

## Testing

### Unit Tests
1. Verify that the RAG service can be instantiated without syntax errors
2. Test the `_chunk_document` method with various content inputs
3. Ensure the default parameter values work correctly

### Integration Tests
1. Test document processing functionality with PDF and DOCX files
2. Verify that the FAISS index is properly created
3. Confirm that similarity search works correctly

## Validation

After implementing the fix:
1. The syntax error should be resolved
2. The application should start without the `SyntaxError`
3. All existing RAG service functionality should remain intact
4. Document processing and similarity search should work as expected
