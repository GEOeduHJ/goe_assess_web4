# Error Analysis: Google Gemini API Integration Issues

## Overview

This document analyzes the error logs from the geography auto-grading system, specifically focusing on issues with the Google Gemini API integration. The errors are preventing the system from properly grading student answers using the LLM service.

## Error Log Summary

From the provided logs, we can identify several key error patterns:

1. **LLM Client Initialization Error**:
   ```
   ERROR - Failed to initialize LLM clients: Client.__init__() got an unexpected keyword argument 'proxies'
   ```

2. **API Communication Error**:
   ```
   WARNING - [API_COMMUNICATION_ERROR] API 통신 오류: Part.from_text() takes 1 positional argument but 2 were given
   ```

## Root Cause Analysis

### 1. Client Initialization Issue

The first error indicates that the Google GenAI client initialization is failing due to an unexpected keyword argument 'proxies'. This suggests a version incompatibility or incorrect parameter passing in the client initialization code.

Looking at the LLM service code in `services/llm_service.py`:

```python
def _initialize_clients(self):
    """Initialize API clients with proper configuration."""
    try:
        # Initialize Google Gemini
        if config.GOOGLE_API_KEY:
            self.gemini_client = genai.Client(api_key=config.GOOGLE_API_KEY)
            logger.info("Google Gemini client initialized successfully")
```

The error suggests that the `genai.Client()` constructor is receiving a `proxies` parameter that it doesn't expect. This could be due to:

1. An outdated version of the `google-genai` library
2. Implicit proxy configuration being passed through environment variables or default HTTP settings
3. A mismatch between the expected API and the actual library implementation

### 2. Part.from_text() Method Signature Issue

The second error indicates that the `Part.from_text()` method is being called with 2 arguments when it only accepts 1 positional argument. Looking at the code in `services/llm_service.py`:

```python
content = [genai.types.Content(parts=[genai.types.Part.from_text(prompt)])]
```

And later:

```python
content = [
    genai.types.Content(parts=[genai.types.Part.from_text(prompt)]),
    genai.types.Content(parts=[image_part])
]
```

According to the Google GenAI documentation, the `Part.from_text()` method should be called with a single argument. However, the error suggests that somewhere in the code, it's being called with 2 arguments.

Looking more closely at the documentation examples:

```python
contents = types.Content(
  role='user',
  parts=[types.Part.from_text(text='Why is the sky blue?')]
)
```

The documentation shows using a named parameter `text=`, but the code is passing the prompt as a positional argument.

## Detailed Error Breakdown

### Error 1: Client Initialization Failure

**Error Message**: `Client.__init__() got an unexpected keyword argument 'proxies'`

**Location**: `services/llm_service.py`, line 49 in `_initialize_clients()`

**Analysis**:
1. The Google GenAI client is being initialized with `genai.Client(api_key=config.GOOGLE_API_KEY)`
2. The error suggests that internally, the client is receiving a `proxies` argument that it doesn't recognize
3. This could be due to:
   - Outdated library version where the API has changed
   - Implicit proxy configuration from environment variables
   - HTTP configuration being passed through that the current library version doesn't support

### Error 2: Part.from_text() Method Signature Mismatch

**Error Message**: `Part.from_text() takes 1 positional argument but 2 were given`

**Location**: `services/llm_service.py`, line 190 in `call_gemini_api()`

**Analysis**:
1. The error occurs when trying to create content parts for the Gemini API
2. The code is calling `genai.types.Part.from_text(prompt)` with `prompt` as a positional argument
3. According to the Google GenAI documentation, the method expects a named parameter: `types.Part.from_text(text='...')`
4. This suggests either:
   - A version mismatch where the API has changed
   - Incorrect usage of the API method

## Technical Context

### Library Versions and Dependencies

Based on the code analysis, the system is using:
- `google-genai` library for Google Gemini integration
- Custom error handling and retry mechanisms
- Configuration management through `config.py`

### API Usage Pattern

The LLM service follows this pattern:
1. Initialize clients with API keys
2. Generate structured prompts based on rubrics
3. Call the appropriate API (Gemini or Groq)
4. Parse and validate responses
5. Return structured grading results

## Recommended Solutions

### Solution 1: Fix Client Initialization

**Issue**: The `genai.Client()` constructor is receiving an unexpected `proxies` argument.

**Fix**:
1. Check the version of the `google-genai` library:
   ```bash
   pip show google-genai
   ```

2. Update to the latest version:
   ```bash
   pip install --upgrade google-genai
   ```

3. If the issue persists, explicitly disable proxy configuration or handle it correctly:
   ```python
   # In services/llm_service.py, modify _initialize_clients():
   try:
       # Initialize Google Gemini
       if config.GOOGLE_API_KEY:
           # Check if we need to handle proxies explicitly
           self.gemini_client = genai.Client(
               api_key=config.GOOGLE_API_KEY,
               # Add http_options if needed, but without proxies if that's causing issues
           )
           logger.info("Google Gemini client initialized successfully")
   ```

### Solution 2: Fix Part.from_text() Method Usage

**Issue**: `Part.from_text()` is being called with incorrect parameters.

**Fix**:
1. Update the method calls to use named parameters as per the documentation:
   ```python
   # In services/llm_service.py, line ~190
   # Change from:
   content = [genai.types.Content(parts=[genai.types.Part.from_text(prompt)])]
   
   # To:
   content = [genai.types.Content(parts=[genai.types.Part.from_text(text=prompt)])]
   ```

2. Apply the same fix to all instances:
   ```python
   # For image content creation:
   content = [
       genai.types.Content(parts=[genai.types.Part.from_text(text=prompt)]),
       genai.types.Content(parts=[image_part])
   ]
   ```

## Implementation Steps

### Step 1: Verify Library Versions

1. Check current `google-genai` version:
   ```bash
   pip show google-genai
   ```

2. Update to the latest version:
   ```bash
   pip install --upgrade google-genai
   ```

### Step 2: Update Method Signatures

1. Modify `services/llm_service.py`:
   - Update all `Part.from_text(prompt)` calls to `Part.from_text(text=prompt)`

### Step 3: Handle Client Initialization

1. If the proxy issue persists, consider:
   - Explicitly configuring HTTP options without proxies
   - Checking environment variables for proxy settings
   - Adding error handling to catch and ignore proxy-related issues

### Step 4: Test Changes

1. Run unit tests for the LLM service
2. Test with a small batch of student answers
3. Verify that both text and image-based grading work correctly

## Prevention Strategies

### 1. Dependency Management

- Pin specific versions of critical libraries in `pyproject.toml`
- Regularly update and test dependencies
- Use virtual environments to isolate dependencies

### 2. Error Handling Improvements

- Add more specific error handling for API initialization
- Implement fallback mechanisms for different library versions
- Add logging for library versions at startup

### 3. Testing

- Add unit tests that specifically test API client initialization
- Include tests for different method signatures across library versions
- Implement integration tests with mock API responses

## Conclusion

The errors in the geography auto-grading system are primarily due to API usage inconsistencies with the Google GenAI library. The main issues are:

1. Client initialization failing due to unexpected proxy parameters
2. Incorrect method signature usage for `Part.from_text()`

These issues can be resolved by updating the library to the latest version and correcting the method calls to match the current API specification. Proper dependency management and testing should be implemented to prevent similar issues in the future.
